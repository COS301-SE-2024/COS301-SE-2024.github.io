						<h2>Computer Science Project Day</h2>
						<p>Software Engineering (SE), COS 301 is a final year module for Computer Science students at the University of Pretoria. The module's presentation integrates subject matter in a very ‘hands-on’ way. Students are expected to design and implement a software system as a project tackled by a team of four to five members. The module covers a range of SE concepts, tools, techniques and skills, team skills and competencies. Usually, a software development process's primary goal is to deliver a high-quality, reliable, innovative and cost-efficient software product. However, our educational scenario's primary goal is to teach software development and engineering. The delivery of a quality product becomes a criterion for measuring acquired proficiency.</p>

Koja is an innovative AI-powered Schedule Management tool meticulously designed to assist users in harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to analyse their calendar events and give suggestions for events the user can schedule for the upcoming week. Unlike traditional calendar apps, Koja doesn't merely track your commitments; it evolves with you.   How Koja Stands Out:  1. Dynamic Event Scheduling: Koja recognises the fluidity of modern schedules. It schedules dynamic events based on when you're actually available, ensuring optimal productivity and balance in your day.  2. Integration with Existing Calendars: By integrating with your existing calendars, Koja gets a comprehensive view of your commitments. This eliminates the need to switch between your existing calendar apps or requiring manually inputting recurring events.  3. Intelligent Adaptability: Utilising sophisticated algorithms, Koja learns from your preferences and patterns. Over time, the tool becomes more attuned to your specific needs, refining its scheduling recommendations for improved personalisation.  4. Optimization for Free Time: It's not just about filling up your schedule but making the most out of your free time. Koja identifies and schedules events in such a way that you're not overwhelmed with the help of time boundaries that you can set and change by yourself, ensuring you have moments of relaxation and personal time.  The Koja Vision:  In a world inundated with tasks, appointments, and responsibilities, Koja aims to bring clarity and simplicity. By fusing the capabilities of AI with the nuances of personal preferences, Koja transforms schedule management from a mundane task into an empowering activity. It's not just about managing time; it's about optimising it. Through Koja, users can look forward to days that are structured yet flexible, productive yet balanced.
